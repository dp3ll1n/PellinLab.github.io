# Pellin Lab

Welcome to the Pellin Lab, the computational lab of the Gene Therapy Program of the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, one of the world's most extensive and long-running pediatric gene therapy programs. Our lab is dedicated to advancing the field of gene therapy through the development and application of quantitative methods. We focus on safety evaluation, single-cell genomics analysis, and modeling of clonal dynamics to ensure the success and safety of gene therapy interventions. Our team of experts combines computational biology, genomics, and data analysis to tackle relevant biological questions and contribute to the next generation of gene therapies.
